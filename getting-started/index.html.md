This section of the Fly.io docs is all about getting you up and running quickly.

Follow [Hands-on](/docs/hands-on/) which takes you through creating an account, installing `flyctl`, the Fly.io command-line tool, and launching a simple demo app.

If you'd rather jump right in, try [Speedrun] to launch your own app fast.

Once that's done, check out our in-depth docs:

* [Language & Frameworks guides](/docs/languages-and-frameworks/) to learn about how we support your langauge or framework
* [Fly Launch] to learn about the features that help you manage and run your apps on the Fly Platform
* [Databases & Storage]
* [Reference]
